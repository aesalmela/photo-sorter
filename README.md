PhotoSorter


This is a Windows application that is used to look for picture and video files in a known dump location, rotate the photo, rename based on the date-time taken then sort the files in a standard fashion based on the year and month taken.  Optionally if you have a shutterfly account you can get a developer api from shutterfly and configure the application to update the files to shutterfly in a stanard fashion as well.

To get started there are a few steps you have to undertake.
